3.0.0   2022-02-14  Released-By: PERLANCAR; Backward-Incompatible: yes; Urgency: medium

        [INCOMPATIBLE CHANGES]

        - Bump specifcation version from 2 to 3 due to incompatible changes.

        - Remove C<chars> in border style structure and abstract it through
          `get_border_char()` to be more flexible, e.g. to allow for footer
          area, vertical header (header columns), and so on.

        - Replace the positional arguments in C<get_border_char()> with named
          arguments to be more flexible. Replace the C<x> and C<y> arguments
          that refer to character with character C<name>, to be more readable.

        [ENHANCEMENTS]

        - Include roles in BorderStyleRole::* to replace BorderStyleBase.
